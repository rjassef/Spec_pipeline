- It seems that the grating information was not preserved for the GMOS
  spectra.  We'll use for now the B600 for everything, but we need to
  Figure this out.

- For Palomar, the information was not saved either, but it seems the
  same grating was always used on each side.

- Add more emission lines to the lines.txt file.

- Implement joint fits for some lines. Easiest is to implement them as
  classes, like an OII class, OIII class, NII_Halpha class, SII class
  for example. For OII, MgII and CIV it is likely we can just get away
  with a single profile for the doublet.
