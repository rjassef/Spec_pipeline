- Fit_chi2 only fits a line for the continuum, even if the model in
  the line class is different.

- It seems that the grating information was not preserved for the GMOS
  spectra.  We'll use for now the B600 for everything, but we need to
  Figure this out.

- For Palomar, the information was not saved eitherm but it seems the
  same grating was always used on each side.

- Add more emission lines to the lines.txt file.
