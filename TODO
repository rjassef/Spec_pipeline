- Incorporate Sensitivities to fitting.

- Implement the line shape as part of the line fitter class with a
  default Gaussian.

- Implement the plotting part of the visualization. 

- Figure out a better way to read the spectra. Specutils code is no
  longer supported. Maybe put everything in ascii?
  
- Fit_chi2 only fits a line for the continuum, even if the model in
  the line class is different.

- It seems that the grating information was not preserved for the GMOS
  spectra.  We'll use for now the B600 for everything, but we need to
  Figure this out.

- For Palomar, the information was not saved eitherm but it seems the
  same grating was always used on each side.
