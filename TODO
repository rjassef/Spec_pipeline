- It seems that the grating information was not preserved for the GMOS
  spectra.  We'll use for now the B600 for everything, but we need to
  Figure this out.

  Solution: Make it a request. We can get the grating list from the
  Gemini archive and then have a lookup table. Not elegant, but will
  work.

- For Palomar, the information was not saved either, but it seems the
  same grating was always used on each side.

- Add more emission lines to the lines.txt file.

- Change continuum fit for Lyalpha to be a step function or something
  more sensible than now.

- Implement joint fits for some lines. Easiest is to implement them as
  classes, like an OII class, OIII class, NII_Halpha class, SII class
  for example. For OII, MgII and CIV it is likely we can just get away
  with a single profile for the doublet.

  Actually, easiest will be to have a single joint class that has
  different properties read from a file. It should allow for: 

  - Centers with the same or with different velocity shifts. 
  - Fixed or variable flux ratios.
  - Same or different widths. 

  Try implementing it as N lines.

- Setup test run for sky fitting, include moon glow.
