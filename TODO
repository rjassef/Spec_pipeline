- Ftest is currently wrong, but should work for what we need (a rough discriminant of the line detection) for the time being. But the number of fit parameters can be off.

- Add IGM absorption. A test version of this already implemented in the test fit module in the LRIS folder.

- Further in the future: could try to incorporate SPAMM into the mix to use all of those models and fit all (broad+narrow) lines simultaneously, the continuum and the iron emission.

- Change the rebin_spec code to not depend on pysynphot. It is the only place where that is used and it makes the load times slower and the code less portable. - Low priority, probably not worth doing.

Done


- Implement joint fits for some lines. Easiest is to implement them as
  classes, like an OII class, OIII class, NII_Halpha class, SII class
  for example. For OII, MgII and CIV it is likely we can just get away
  with a single profile for the doublet.

  Actually, easiest will be to have a single joint class that has
  different properties read from a file. It should allow for:

  - Centers with the same or with different velocity shifts.
  - Fixed or variable flux ratios.
  - Same or different widths.

  Try implementing it as N lines.

  Solution: N-lines class implemented.


- Change continuum fit for Lyalpha to be a step function or something
  more sensible than now. SOLUTION: Just used the red continuum side.

- For Palomar, the information was not saved either, but it seems the
  same grating was always used on each side. Solution: Dan confirms
  same setup was always used.


- It seems that the grating information was not preserved for the GMOS
  spectra.  We'll use for now the B600 for everything, but we need to
  Figure this out.

  Solution: Make it a request. We can get the grating list from the
  Gemini archive and then have a lookup table. Not elegant, but will
  work. - Now requested by spec_reader.

- Add more emission lines to the lines.txt file. Lines to fit for:

  OVI/Lyb
  Lya/NV
  CIV
  HeII 1640
  CIII
  CII 2326
  NeIV 2440
  MgII
  OII  3727
  NeIII 3868.74
  Hbeta
  OIII

  Solution: Done


- Setup test run for sky fitting, include moon glow. DONE

- For LRIS eliminate 50A in the borders to avoid dichroic issues. Instead, use dichroic. DONE

- First fit all lines. Use the one with the highest SNR (or all above SNR 25) to fix the velocity shift and only allow shifts of ~500km/s afterwards. This should stop the issues of having very broad, low peak flux emission lines fitting systematics in the continuum. - Actually, after eliminating the dichroic issue above, the error must be better fitted, and these lines stopped appearing at SNR>5. Keep and eye on this however.


- When that is done, setup the fitting such that a "default" spectrum can be loaded at the time when the fitting object is created. The fitting subroutines can still be called with an spec object in the call, but if no spec object is provided, then the default is used. The complication here is that now, for loading the spectrum, we need to provide the line that we want to fit so the correct side can be loaded. - DONE. Now allows user to load a default spectrum when creating the line_fitter object, or to provide it when fitting.

- Modify the fitting function to fit continuum and emission line simultaneously (take it from the test fit module in LRIS folder.) DONE

- Add the second way of measuring the SNR. DONE

- Combine OII into a single emission line at the average position of the doublet. - NOT IMPLEMENTED. This could through off the redshift calibration steps.

- Include Halpha+NII. This is difficult, as there are really four components to keep track of: the two NII lines, narrow Halpha and broad Halpha. I guess we could just do a single Gaussian each with the correct NII ratio, and just assume a single Halpha. The width of NII would need to be limited to 1000 km/s, but not the width Halpha, to accommodate an offset broad Halpha emission. - Done.

- Remove the difference of continuum and non-continuum parameters from the line class and new_fit_general codes at let it be handled at the subclass level. This will provide flexibility needed for more complex line classes that can fit multiple lines simultaneously for example. Biggest complication is how to handle the F-test, but that should not be difficult, just pass all the parameters to both the continuum and the line modeling, and let those functions handle it from there. DONE

- Include instrumental resolution in line widths. DONE

- Implement DEIMOS reading module. DONE

- DEIMOS_Spec module currently using the GMOS Sky template. Need to update it. DONE

- It seems that although the procedure to determine the uncertainties is working OK, it still fails in some cases. This might be an inherent problem, not quite sure what is the best way to proceed. - Solved. The issue was that the calculation of the error spectrum considered the smoothed measured flux directly, which could include negative values (that gave a nan when taking the square root), and that was biasing the fitted error spectrum to be very low. I changed it to now consider the absolute value of the flux. This is better than simply disregarding the wavelength bins with a negative flux, as a negative flux must imply a significant uncertainty. At most, then, the error may become a bit too large, which is better than too small.

- Add digitization noise to RON. DONE

- Add n_pix term to RON. DONE

- Assume 1.25" slits are used at all times. DONE

- Add the rest of the Balmer series emission lines. DONE.

- Do not use the A-band and B-band absorption regions in fits. DONE.

- Print EWs as part of the default output. DONE.

- We are considering OVI as a single emission line at 1033.82 A (vacuum) following the SDSS list of emission lines. However, NIST lists it as a doublet, at 1031.912A and 1037.613A (vacuum). Here, http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/drewski/tableofemissionlines.html, it is also listed as a doublet. Perhaps we should be fitting it as a doublet to not affect the redshift determinations, yet this is unlikely to be too much of an issue. Also, we would need to know the line ratio too. - Solution: Considering SDSS list instead for doublets. - DONE

- Add extrapolation from sensitivity curves to match extracted spectral range. DONE

- For Lyalpha, the continuum is allowed to be negative under the emission line. This is a generic problem for emission lines with only one continuum region. Solve this by requiring that the continuum is also non-negative below the emission line, not just in the continuum regions. - DONE. Added routine to check continuum in line fitting region as well.

- Add capacity of different setups to DBSP. - May not be necessary in the end, I added the possibility of using local sky and sensitivity files. - Actually, this causes a problem with the wavelength coverage from the sky template. A solution is to spline the two sides together to just create a single sky spectrum. This would likely work OK, but it is not ideal. - DONE for the most part. Need to improve still the sky templates.

- Remove places of known emission lines and telluric absorption from the error-fit range. Alternative, could put a 3-5 sigma clipping iteration. DONE

- No Dichroich information in DEIMOS data headers. From the data of W0757 we will assume 640nm. DONE No dichroic in DEIMOS, only a chip gap that Dan uses to split blue and red, but it is a single channel spectrograph.

- Add multiple setups for LRIS. DONE

- Add multiple setups for GMOS (mostly done already). DONE

- Add multiple setups for DEIMOS. DONE

- Assuming a single setup for DEIMOS, not sure this is correct though, and not sure which one it is. We'll assume 600ZD for now. - DONE

- - Need to modify SNR_wing to measure the noise from the median of the MC distribution rather than from the best-fit value, at least in the case where one or more of the best-fit parameters are at the edge of their allowed values. In particular for FWHM, this can result in lines that do not have lower fluxes than the best-fit in the MC. - SNR_wing DEPRECATED

- Make the loader accept one spectrum at a time. Remove the scheme to find the channel of interest in dual spec based on a wavelength of interest. DONE

- Put default keyword headers in a configuration file. DONE

- When calculating the flux of an emission line for the S/N, we should only use the regions within the spectrum. DONE

- Fix negative fluxes in sky template for DBSP - WILL NOT NEED TO DO. Requested new templates from Dan.
