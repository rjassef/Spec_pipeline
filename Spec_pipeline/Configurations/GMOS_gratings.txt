# Taken from http://www.gemini.edu/node/10654 . Values taken for the EEV chips, although it should not matter. Dispersion obtained by dividing the dispersion in nm/pix by the pixel size. For the FWHM, we used the resolving power at the blaze and the blaze wavelength to determine delta_lam, and assumed delta_lam equals to FWHM. Then, we multiplied by to go from the 0.5" slit to a 1" slit.
