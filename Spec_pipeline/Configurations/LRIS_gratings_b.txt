#Obtained from https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/lris/dispersive_elements.html. I understand that the dispersions listed in the webpage are in units of AA/pixel, so I am dividing by the pixel size of 15um to turn them into AA/mm. The resolution obtained for a 1" slit is slightly larger than listed, and could be due, in principle, to a factor 1.22 due to the diffraction (location of the first order 0). Should check, but difference is quite minimal in the end.
