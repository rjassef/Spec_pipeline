The blue side D55 sky spectrum was obtained with a 2.0" slit width while the D68 side was taken with a 1.5". I have asked Dan already for the D55 one with the 1.5" slit (Nov. 05, 2020)

The red side was taken with the 316 grating, so the 600 grating template is just a copy of the lower resolution one.
