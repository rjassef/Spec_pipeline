Need details. For now, just assuming all blue are the same, as well as all red. We are only using the 1.5" slit, so assuming that as well for now.

Details sent by Dan (11/01/2021) on the files sent on 09/10/2019: sky_keck_b.w.fits and sky_keck_r.w.fits. He says that:

"Looking on my laptop, I have processed data from an LRIS run on UT 2019 February 6.  George Djorgovski was the observer.

Looks like the whole night was done with the following configuration:

1.0" slit
D560 dichroic
600/4000 grism
400/8500 grating

"

Note also from original email that:

"And here's an example of the Keck/LRIS sky, in cts, from February 2019 observations (of CRTS J1241+2034, for the sake of completeness)."
